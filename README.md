Assignment 2 for Mobile Robotics

Step 1: Attach the light ,touch and ultrasonic sensors to your robot with 2 motors;

Step 2: With support from all the tutorials used in the module and the leJOS NXT API, make a "vacuum cleaner" Robot that will:
  
  a) Firstly do a recognition lap around a room, at about 20 units distance from the walls (depending on your robot's size)
  b) Secondly cover all the floor area in parallel movements, 7 units distance from each other.
      * It should avoid any obstacles found in the room.
      * It should also recognise when it's going through a carpet( material of different colour from the floor). When it does, it         should beep and print "Carpet" on the screen.
  c) If it bumps into something, it should stop - this is also the exit condition from the program.
